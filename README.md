A little game I wrote for my dad.

I don't quite remember how it works, but there is a chance that I will get back
to it, so I will explain it in this README eventually. Maybe.

## Localisation

`src/locale.rs` holds some language specific stuff. Currently they are in Czech
but you can simply translate and rewrite them. If you want to know where the
different variables are used, just grep for them.
